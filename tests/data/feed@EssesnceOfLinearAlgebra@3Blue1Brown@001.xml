*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result, since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.

For anyone who wants to understand the cross-product more deeply, this video shows how it relates to a certain linear transformation via duality.  This perspective gives a very elegant explanation of why the traditional computation of a dot product corresponds to its geometric interpretation.

Minor error at 1:44, the third line of the matrix should read &quot;v1 * w2 - w1 * v2&quot;

*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.
